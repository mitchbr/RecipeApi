Welcome to the Recipe API! This API is actively being improved every day, my goal is to begin incorporating it into my Grocery Tracker application.

While that is in the works and not complete yet, I built a simple Flutter frontend for the API as a PoC and testing area.

If you would like to read more about the recipe API, the best information is on my portfolio site: https://mitchbr.github.io/mitchbr/recipe_api.html

If you would like to test the API for yourself, there is an available [Postman Collection](https://web.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~4d525aab-f050-462c-8b0f-26a21dae4de1/collection/21203434-f5892415-d1dc-4585-b828-b9ceb60b9297)

Thank you for checking this project out!
